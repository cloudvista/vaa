### Summary
VAA is a first-ever comprehensive capture and analysis VA's actual clinical workflows. VAA is based on the capture of all traffic generated by all users and usage of all point-of-care applications currently in operation at VA medical centers. All workflow is identifiable by user, specialty, facility. Down to the millisecond.

VAA captures and analyzes VA clinical workflows to improve the use of current clients - improving clinical efficiency, expanding access to care, and reducing costs. 
The captured workflows also enable existing activity to  be migrated to new clients and systems -  without a loss of clinical efficiency.

This traffic-based approach to capturing workflow is a proven, emprical, data-driven approach. It is not notional or speculative. It is not based on a human observer with a stopwatch. VAA comprehensively captures all the traffic - containing all the institutional knowledge and nuances of veteran-specific care - all the way down to the individual transaction.

The most important point-of-care application used by all VA clinical staff for all veteran care is CPRS.  Each day CPRS processes over 50 million new documents, orders, labs, alerts, and transactions for veteran care. Annually CPRS supports more than 115 million veteran care encounters.  Saving just one minute per veteran care encounter would save 115 million minutes across the VA - giving back 2 million hours of more clinical care to veterans at no additional cost.


### Introduction
Each day in VA clinical staff use a suite of VistA point-of-care applications (CPRS, Imaging, and 40+ others) to create and process over 50 million documents, orders, labs, images, and transactions for veteran care.  In an average work week, VA staff use CPRS - the main VistA application - more than 4.4 million hours. The use of the CPRS Vista application is more than any other application in VA - even more than all Microsoft Office applications combined.

All VistA Applications process their transactions on VistA via remote procedure calls. In aggregate, these remote procedure calls (RPCs) between VistA Applications and VistA describe all clinical care transactions and workflows performed at VA medical centers.

### Background
To provide a modern platform for veteran healthcare delivery, VA has migrated all VistA systems from their many legacy, decentralized environments across the country to a single, centralized, commercially-supported cloud platform managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS).  

This centralized cloud platform for VistA provides over two hundred new features, capabilities, and improvements for VistA that can be used to improve the quality, efficiency, and access of VA care for veterans. (See: [AWS Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/introduction.html))

</p>

By leveraging the traffic streaming capability of cloud-based VistA, VHA has the first-ever opportunity to comprehensively analyze the actual workflows of all clinical staff at VA medical centers.  Such analysis would drive improved standards of practice by health care providers. These improvements would be prompted by the actual practice of care and not speculation about how care is being provided.

### Overview of Analysis
The Vista Application Analytics project will capture and analyze all end-user traffic between all VistA clients (VistA Applications) and cloud-based VistA.  This analysis will provide precise reports detailing different aspect of VA care. Analysis will include the types and volumes of structured and unstructured information read and written by clearly identified types of healthcare providers and the range of time spent on different tasks. On completion, VHA will possess a set of concrete, actionable recommendations;  demonstrations for improving  veteran care workflows and efficiency; and a comprehensie guide to perform such analyses in the future.

#### Workflow Capture
All VistA client workflows (RPC traffic flows) of cloud-based VistA are streamed to cloud storage using the built-in traffic mirroring service in the AWS Cloud.

#### Workflow Analysis
Workflow analysis is comprised of sequential levels of increasingly nuanced analysis, each of which builds on the other:  

A. __Metrics Analysis (Statistical Analysis)__: Raw unprocessed RPC traffic is quality controlled for completeness and correctness. RPCs are identified by volume, type, use, and client

B. __Workflow Correlation Analysis (Semantic Analysis)__: Correlate the RPC sequences to each client screen and the associated user interactions (i.e. what the doctor sees and does on the screen is correlated to the RPC sequences that this generates).  This correlation is built on four parallel analyses:  
1. __Usage Analysis__: Variety of specific RPCs used by specific VistA clients (Example: 850+ distinct RPCs used by CPRS)  
2. __Sequence Analysis__: Identify the longest common sequence of RPCs behind each transaction (Eample: RPC sequence for updating an allergy)
3. __Screen Analysis__: Identify the client screens specific to each workflow (Example: screens the user sees when updating an allergy)
4. __Document Analysis__:  Identify the user documentation specific to each workflow (Example: user guide for updating an allergy)
