### Introduction
To provide a modern, centralized cloud-based platform for veteran healthcare, VA has migrated all VistA systems to the VA Enterprise Cloud, a federally certified commercial cloud managed by Amazon Web Services. VA's new centralized cloud-based VistA ("Cloud VistA") provides many new features and capabilities to VistA and veteran care.

By leveraging the new cloud-based traffic streaming capabilities of cloud-based VistA, VHA has the first-ever opportunity to comprehensively analyze the clinical workflows of all staff at VA medical centers.  Such analysis would drive improved standards of practice by health care providers. These improvements would be prompted by the actual practice of care and not speculation about how care is being provided.

### Background
Each day VHA clinical staff use a suite of VistA Applications to create and process over 4 million new documents, lab orders, pharmacy orders, and imaging studies in VistA. All VistA Applications remotely access and process all their transactions on VistA via remote procedure calls (RPCs).  In aggregate, these RPCs between VistA Applications and VistA describe all clinical care transactions and workflow performed at VHA medical centers.

### Overview of Analysis
The Vista Application Analytics (VAA) project will engage VistA data experts to analyze the RPC traffic between VistA clients and three representative VistA servers. The analysis will be provided in a series of precise reports, detailing different aspect of VA care. Analysis will include the types and volumes of structured and unstructured information read and written by clearly identified classes of health care professional as well as the range of time spent on different tasks.  On completion, VHA will possess a set of concrete, actionable recommendations, and demonstrations for improving the care provided to Veterans as well as a guide for how to perform such analysis in the future.

__Note__: The main VistA Application used by all VHA clinical staff at all VA medical centers for veteran care is the Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS). The VAA project will therefore focus on CPRS workflows.


#### Workflow Capture
All VistA Application workflows (RPC traffic) of cloud-based VistA is streamed to cloud storage using the built-in traffic mirroring service in the AWS Cloud.

</p>


#### Workflow Analytics
Using the RPC traffic captured, multiple parallel analyses will occur.
1. __Composite Analysis__: Simple and filtered analysis of *all* traffic from *all* users for *all*  applications of a specific VistA server. This provides *screen metrics* to be used in the VistA application-specific analysis.
2. __Sequence Analysis__: Identify and classify the longest common sequences (LCS) of RPCs generated by a given VistA Application. These LCS correspond to the *actual workflow* of end-users of a given VistA Application.
3. __Workflow Analysis__: The Vista Documentation Library (VDL) contains the User Guides for VistA Applications, which is the *documented workflow* of VistA Applications. The documentation and screenshots of specific VistA Applications are parsed and classified in a standardized computable form to permit analysis.
4. __Workflow Correlation Analysis__ - Correlate the (1) Actual screens generated by live users of a VistA Application (2) Documented screens based on the VDL descriptions for specific VistA Applications (3) Actual workflow - based on the LCS analyss of known RPCs an their fuction.

### Analysis of All VistA Client Traffic

Using the client traffic captured, the Analysis Team shall provide Traffic Analysis comprising all client traffic of all users for each of the three VistA systems. In addition, the Analysis Team shall provide a cross-VistA Analysis Report distinguishing cross-VistA from VistA-specific traffic patterns. All four reports (i.e. 3 Traffic Analysis Reports and 1 Cross VistA Analysis Report) will be composed in GitHub compatible markdown with embedded graphics where appropriate. The Analysis Team shall store all four reports as markdown in the VA Enterprise GitHub. 

Traffic Analysis Report for each VistA shall characterize:  
a)	User volume  
b)	Client types and volume of use  
c)	Connection volumes, frequency, and duration  
d)	Types of user authentication/security and relative use  
e)	Machine from end Users  
f)	RPC usage frequency and execution times  
g)	RPC groupings â€“ representing transactions  
h)	RPCs specific to a VistA from cross-VistA RPCs  

DELIVERABLES:  
A.	Traffic Analysis Reports for three production VistAs  
B.	Cross VistA Traffic Analysis Report



### Analysis of Use of Key VistA Clients

Based on the traffic and client types isolated during the VistA traffic analysis, the Analysis Team shall produce a detailed Client Traffic Analysis of the operation of three of the most used VistA point-of-care applications ("Clients"). CPRS shall be one of the three; the remaining two shall be chosen after project start based on client usage. All three reports shall be composed in GitHub compatible markdown with embedded graphics where appropriate.  The Analysis Team shall store the three reports in a git in the VA Enterprise GitHub.   All client analyses must be validated and verifiable in a demonstrable way, matching RPC flows to specific client screens and typical tasks. The Contractor shall document the verification and validation of the analysis and provide a Client Traffic Analysis Validation and Verification Report. 

The per Client Traffic Analysis shall include:  
a)	User volumes and types. User types shall capture clinical care specialties and roles.  
b)	Connection volume and duration, tying frequency of client use to user types  
c)	Types of user authentication/security and relative use  
d)	Patient volumes  
e)	Enumeration of all RPCs used by a client and their relative use  
f)	Distinction of clinical from non-clinical RPCs  
g)	Distinction of RPCs that change (write) from those that read the clinical record  
h)	Distinction of slow running, high overhead and variable overhead RPCs  
i)	Clinical care task sets, represented as groups of RPCs used in tandem  
j)	Match task sets with the use of one or more specific client screens  
k)	Task sets employed by different user types  
l)	Isolate performance issues with patterns of use that slow care  
m)	Verification and validation that the analysis accurately captures care provision  

Deliverables:  
A.	Three (3)  VistA Client Use Analysis Reports  
B.	Client Analysis Validation and Verification Report


Note: This task requires the contractor to match the RPC traffic flows to client screens and tasks.  There will be a unique RPC flow associated with each task (login, logoff, ordering a medication, ordering a lab, writing notes, etc.). There will be hundreds of unique RPC flows - one for each interaction / task.   The contractor must explain HOW they will do this matching of RPC flows to client screens user tasks.  The contractor must also demonstrate that the matching of these RPC flows to specific screens and tasks are complete and correct.



### VistA Client Use Improvement

Based solely   on the Client Use Analysis Reports, the Contractor shall provide recommendations to upgrade the use of the top three RPC-using Point-of-Care VistA Clients to deliver better clinical care. These recommendations shall be documented in Client Use Improvement Reports for each Client in Microsoft Word and a supporting PowerPoint presentation. 

Deliverables:  
A.	Client Use Improvement Reports  


Note: This task requires the Analysis Team to provide recommendations to upgrade CPRS (and two other clients) to deliver better clinical care (more safe, more efficient, etc). These recommendations must come from soley the clinical workflow (RPC flows) analysis of section 5.2.3.
