## Introduction
Each day across VA clinical staff use a suite of VistA Applications (Windows desktop applications) to create and process 50+ million documents, orders, labs, images, reminders, and transactions in VistA. All VistA Applications (VistA clients) process their transactions remotely on VistA via remote procedure calls. In aggregate, these remote procedure calls (RPCs) between VistA clients and VistA describe all clinical care transactions and workflows performed at VHA medical centers.

</p>

## Background
To provide a modern, centralized cloud-based platform for veteran healthcare delivery, VA has migrated all VistA systems to the VA Enterprise Cloud, a federally certified commercial cloud managed by Amazon Web Services (AWS). This new AWS Cloud platform for VistA provides over 200 new features and capabilities to VistA that can be used to improve veteran care quality, efficiency, and access. (See: [AWS Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-overview/introduction.html))

</p>

By leveraging VistA's new AWS cloud-based traffic streaming capability, VHA has the first-ever opportunity to comprehensively analyze the clinical workflows of all staff at VA medical centers.  Such analysis would drive improved standards of practice by health care providers. These improvements would be prompted by the actual practice of care and not speculation about how care is being provided.


## VAA Use Cases
Below are use cases of VistA Application Analytics to provide actionable insight on VHA clinical workflows. 

__Efficiency__     
Identify and minimize the process and latency of key workflows of CPRS, such as:
1. Login process and time: 
2. Cover sheet load time:
3. Note switching process and time:  Example: switching from Visit Pending Note to GMC-Attending Note for a given patient
4. Note template load time: Example: Large/complex national standarized note templates such as TRVC consults
5. Alert when results available latency: Improve real-time alerting when results are available from lab or other domains


# Overview of Analysis
The Vista Application Analytics team will analyze the RPC traffic between all VistA clients and three representative Cloud VistA servers.   The analysis will provide precise reports detailing different aspect of VA care. Analysis will include the types and volumes of structured and unstructured information read and written by clearly identified types of healthcare providers and the range of time spent on different tasks.  On completion, VHA will possess a set of concrete, actionable recommendations;  demonstrations for improving  veteran care workflows and efficiency; and a comprehensie guide to perform such analyses in the future.

#### Workflow Capture
All VistA Application workflows (RPC traffic flows) of cloud-based VistA are streamed to cloud storage using the built-in traffic mirroring service in the AWS Cloud.

</p>

#### Workflow Analytics
Using the RPC traffic captured, multiple parallel analyses will occur.
1. __Composite Analysis__: Simple and filtered analysis of *all* traffic from *all* users for *all*  applications of a specific VistA server. This provides *screen metrics* to be used in the VistA application-specific analysis.
2. __Sequence Analysis__: Identify and classify the longest common sequences (LCS) of RPCs generated by a given VistA Application. These LCS correspond to the *actual workflow* of end-users of a given VistA Application.
3. __Workflow Analysis__: The Vista Documentation Library (VDL) contains the User Guides for VistA Applications, which is the *documented workflow* of VistA Applications. The documentation and screenshots of specific VistA Applications are parsed and classified in a standardized computable form to permit analysis.
4. __Workflow Correlation Analysis__ - Correlate the (1) Actual screens generated by live users of a VistA Application (2) Documented screens based on the VDL descriptions for specific VistA Applications (3) Actual workflow - based on the LCS analyss of known RPCs an their fuction.

#### Analytics Methods

| analysis | storage | technique | summary |
|---------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Simple |  S3 | direct RPC queries | foundation metrics|
| Filtered | DynamoDB | RPC extraction scripts | RPC name, type, attributes |
| Sequence | RedshiftDB | RPC sequence reduction | longest common sequence (LCS) identification |
| Workflow | Github | VDL reduction | download -> parse, isolate, index -> flowchart (mermaid) |
| Correlation | Github | sequence comparison to workflow | Task Set identification |


#### VistA Client Traffic Analysis
The VAA team will analyze *all traffic* of *all users* of *all VistA clients* for three VistA systems. 
The Analysis Team will also provide *inter-VistA traffic analysis*, distinguishing common (enterprise, standardized) VistA traffic patterns from VistA-specific (local, specialized) traffic patterns.

Traffic Analysis for each VistA shall characterize:  
a)	User volume  
b)	Client types and volume of use  
c)	Connection volumes, frequency, and duration  
d)	Types of user authentication/security and relative use  
e)	Machine from end Users  
f)	RPC usage frequency and execution times  
g)	RPC groupings â€“ representing transactions  
h)	RPCs specific to a VistA from cross-VistA RPCs  

Deliverables:  
A.	Traffic Analysis Reports for three production VistAs  
B.	Cross VistA Traffic Analysis Report


#### Key VistA Client Traffic Analysis
Based on the traffic and client types isolated in the VistA traffic analysis, the Analysis Team will analyze the operation of three of the most used VistA Applications ("Clients"). 
CPRS shall be one of the three; the remaining two shall be chosen based on client usage.  

The per Client Traffic Analysis will include:  
a)	User volumes and types. User types shall capture clinical care specialties and roles.  
b)	Connection volume and duration, tying frequency of client use to user types  
c)	Types of user authentication/security and relative use  
d)	Patient volumes  
e)	Enumeration of all RPCs used by a client and their relative use  
f)	Distinction of clinical from non-clinical RPCs  
g)	Distinction of RPCs that change (write) from those that read the clinical record  
h)	Distinction of slow running, high overhead and variable overhead RPCs  
i)	Clinical care task sets, represented as groups of RPCs used to perform specific clinical tasks  
j)	Match task sets with the use of one or more specific client screens  
k)	Task sets employed by different user types  (nursing, physician, and all identifiable specialties)
l)	Isolate performance issues with patterns of use that slow care  
m)	Verification and validation that the analysis accurately captures care provision  


### VistA Client Use Improvement

Based solely on the Client Use Analysis Reports, the Analysis Team shall provide recommendations to upgrade the use of the top three RPC-using VistA Clients to deliver better clinical care. These recommendations shall be documented in Client Use Improvement Reports.

Deliverables:  
A.	Client Use Improvement Reports
