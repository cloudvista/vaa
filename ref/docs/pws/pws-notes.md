#### VistA Client Traffic Analysis
The VAA team will analyze *all traffic* of *all users* of *all VistA clients* for three VistA systems. 

The Analysis Team will also provide *inter-VistA traffic analysis*, distinguishing common (enterprise standardized) VistA traffic patterns from local, site-specific VistA traffic patterns.

Traffic Analysis for each VistA will characterize:  
a)	User volume  
b)	Client types and volume of use  
c)	Connection volumes, frequency, and duration  
d)	Types of user authentication/security and relative use  
e)	Machine from end User   
f)	RPC usage frequency and execution times  
g)	RPC groupings â€“ representing transactions  
h)	RPCs specific to a VistA from cross-VistA RPCs  

Deliverables:  
A.	Traffic Analysis Reports for three production VistAs  
B.	Cross VistA Traffic Analysis Report


#### Key VistA Client Traffic Analysis
Based on the traffic and client types isolated in the VistA traffic analysis, the VAA team will analyze the operation of three of the most used VistA Applications ("Clients").  CPRS shall be one of the three; the remaining two shall be chosen based on client usage.  

The Client-specific Traffic Analysis will include:  
a)	User volumes and types. User types shall capture clinical care specialties and roles.  
b)	Connection volume and duration, tying frequency of client use to user types  
c)	Types of user authentication/security and relative use  
d)	Patient volumes  
e)	Enumeration of all RPCs used by a client and their relative use  
f)	Distinction of clinical from non-clinical RPCs  
g)	Distinction of RPCs that change (write) from those that read the clinical record  
h)	Distinction of slow running, high overhead and variable overhead RPCs  
i)	Clinical care task sets, represented as groups of RPCs used to perform specific clinical tasks  
j)	Match task sets with the use of one or more specific client screens  
k)	Task sets employed by different user types  (nursing, physician, and all identifiable specialties)
l)	Isolate performance issues with patterns of use that slow care  
m)	Verification and validation that the analysis accurately captures care provision  

#### VistA Client Use Improvement

Based solely on the Client Use Analysis Reports, the Analysis Team shall provide recommendations to upgrade the use of the top three RPC-using VistA Clients to deliver better clinical care. These recommendations shall be documented in Client Use Improvement Reports.

Deliverables:  
A.	Client Use Improvement Reports  


### Other Use Cases
VistA Application Analytics can provide actionable insight a wide range of other VHA clinical workflows, including the following:

__Efficiency__     
Identify and minimize the process and latency of key workflows of CPRS, such as:
1. Login process and time 
2. Cover sheet load time
3. Note template load time: Large/complex note templates (TRVC consults, etc)
4. Real-tiime alert optimization: Improve real-time alerting when results are available from lab or other domains
