#### Epic Description

#### To 
achieve a process that is standardized, timely, transparent, coordinated, and effective.

#### For
Veterans under the care of a VA primary care provider

#### Who: 
Need referral to ambulatory specialty care provider

#### The: 
Content, Process, and Technology involved with referral management is as-expected, effective, and efficient from the perspective of both the referral requesting and receiving ends

#### Is A: 
learning, data-enabled process that reduces manual information collection, management, and processing

#### That: 
Is observed to be seamless, efficient, and results in a reduction in cancellation of referrals and an increase in access to timely, clinically-indicated (appropriate) care

#### Unlike: 
the current state that is observed to be a) burdensome due to manual tracking and fulfillment and b) results in a mismatch of expectations between the requesting provider and the receiving provider

#### Our Solution: 
Is characterized by increased enterprise-wide transparency, traceability, consistency, reliability, and a high success rate.

#### Business Outcome Hypothesis
Average number of days for referral fulfillment (e.g., from initial request to Veteran patient visit with specialty provider, adjusted by urgency of request)
Proportion of Veterans with at least one favorable experience with referral from their primary care provider to a specialty care provider
Proportion of referrals for the care of a Veteran that are resubmitted for the same clinical concern
Reduction in referral cancellation rate
Reduction referral re-work rate
Results of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) eClinical Quality Measure (eCQM) Closing the Referral Loop: Receipt of Specialist Report[1]

#### Leading Indicators
Use of the referral management solution (by clinical concern, clinical nature of referral or target specialty domain)
Time necessary to fully complete the request for a referral
Percent of referrals that are cancelled
Average number of days for referral processing (e.g., referral request accepted by receiving specialist)
Availability of encounter note or procedure note with specialist provider

#### In scope
Outpatient, ambulatory referral requests
From VA provider to VA provider (i.e., internal to VHA)
All VA EHR Systems
Development of standard data elements and structured data management
Optimization of the content of referral requests

#### Out of scope
Inpatient consult requests
From VA provider to non-VA provider (i.e., external to VHA)
Changes to the workflow of EHR documentation management

#### Nonfunctional requirements
Tools: uptime at or above service level agreement levels; latency lower than established upper threshold
Auditability: the end-to-end process can be objectively observed and compared against standards and performance measures

Usability: 
methods, tools, and process are accessible and usable to those involved in the execution of referral management

Privacy: the solution adheres to relevant data privacy expectations, such as regulations and laws
Scalability: the solution is designed to scale to local, regional, and enterprise use
Interoperability: the solution is based on well-established interoperability standards, including but not limited to data exchange, document sharing, and health care processes

#### Minimum Viable Product Features
Set of Standard Service Level Agreements
Set of integrated Standard Operating Procedure
Capabilities to manage data: patients, providers, and processes
Capabiliites to measure and report performance of the solution
Additional Potential Features

Automation of data management, processing, analysis, and presentation
Reports necessary for proactive, data-driven management and oversight of process that reflects the clinical features of referrals
Analytics (that yield insights) for detection of opportunities for ongoing learning and optimization
