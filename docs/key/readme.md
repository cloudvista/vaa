My title is as follows:
 
Scott Pawikowski, MD
 
Director, Improvement and Innovation
 
VHA Office of Primary Care (11PC)
 
What is the name of the organization this is being presented to?
 
We are presenting to the Hines Informatics Steering Committee (ISC)
 
Thanks for the support!
 
In theory, this is a presentation to engage Hines (a complexity level 1A VAMC in VISN12) into becoming a VAA pilot site
 
So we put our 'ask' up front or in the last slide?
 
or both
